This simple website was created as a **training exercise** to practice using HTML and CSS, and to better understand how they work together to create a user-friendly website.
The design was mainly inspired by Medium.com, as I personally like the readability and the clean look of their blogs.
Please note that the content on this website was **not** the primary focus of the project, and thus should not serve as a basis for cybersecurity advice of any sort.
